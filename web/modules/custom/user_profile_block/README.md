# User Profile Block

## Description:

The users on your site would like to see their account details on the homepage and be able to manage the details from the same block.

Create a custom block plugin that allows users to update their profile information directly from a block. The block form should include fields for the user's First Name, Last Name and Contact Number. The block should only be visible to logged-in users.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- Ensure you have the First Name, Last Name and Contact Number fields added to the user signup form.
- Create a custom block plugin.
- Populate the form fields with the current user's data.
- Save the updated profile information to the user's account upon form submission.
- The block should at any point of time reflect the updated user data. Implement appropriate cache tags and contexts.
